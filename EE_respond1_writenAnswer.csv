,text,Trust,boring,lively,persuasive,reasonable,trustworthy,logical,feel about the topic
1,"seems the speaker is concerned about the lack of justification for certain governmental rights of espionage. their tone is direct and resolute, but at the same time they keep a composed stance it seems",4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4
2,"though the speaker is knowledgeable and appears trustworthy, this topic is too unfamiliar, i mostly feel bored reading this transcript",4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2
3,"rising water levels due to global warming. i don't feel positive about it so much as i think it's necessary to keep at the forefront of public discourse. the speaker seems quite antipathetic toward the science that made erroneous predictions, that makes them sound as if also against the need to trust global warming science in general",2,3,4,4,2,2,4,4
4,"i don't feel great about this topic because the conversations we hear on public media are never fully accounting for the nuance, even the human suffering behind the topic. besides i tend to distrust the speaker's submissions on matters regarding what the government thinks or says",4,2,3,4,4,4,4,2
5,"i am unfamiliar with the names, but i feel quite entertained by the self-righteous confidence of the speaker",1,1,5,4,2,2,2,3
6,this just sounds like unabashed political campaign gossip. yikes,1,4,2,3,2,2,2,2
7,"all of these predictions in the end amount to too many reasons to become paranoid, at this stage of the pandemic. appeals to research data in my opinion do little to remove the speculative factors of it all",4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2
8,cultural differences vis a vis consumer habits is something i can relate to. i think the speaker is quite persuasive making recourse of personal experience and appealing to the fact that grocery shopping could easily be made much simpler,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4
9,"this speaker's trustworthiness comes from their insider's knowledge of the topic. therefore he is just telling his experience, and trusted almost automatically. or at least regarding such a low stakes topic such as the praying customs of the team",5,2,2,3,3,4,3,4
10,"it's good to do some meta-thinking around one's mental habits i guess, specially around interpersonal relationships. but this speaker's arguments are a little circular? or just disorganized",2,4,4,2,2,3,2,4
11,"offering commentary on an illustrated book, i have no real opinion",3,2,4,3,3,3,3,4
12,"compensation for vaccine injury is news to me. even the fact that you can get injured from a vaccine. but to be honest i didn't read read the entire paragraph. i guess i feel good about the topic, seems fair and encouraging for people who may have reservations before they get vaxd",4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4
13,i guess the speaker is just offering a simplified version of what it means to vote and the reasons that make a particular voting choice attractive to a given person,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4
14,"i do enjoy my opinionated geeks. i also think they make a great point, and from experience i can corroborate that this softening of the weirdness from an original to a skin and bone adaptation of anime is often true. so i guess i trust them based on my experience more than on the topic as i don't really know the exact anime they're discussing",4,2,4,4,4,4,4,5
15,"negatively because bored of the topic. also it seems to me that people who start by ""im not going to pretend that..."" may be showcasing a certain defensiveness from the start. that makes them a little less trustworthy perhaps regardless of the content of their argument",2,4,2,2,4,2,4,2
16,"this just seems to be a debate, so by definition not a lot of trust going on",2,2,5,2,3,3,3,4
17,"this kept me interested because it's gossip, sort of behind the scenes type of info. the speaker seems to be critical of walgreens by the way they frame the anecdote",4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4
18,"these are good and simple measures, i guess. but i think it's been proven that no matter how much people know what the right thing to do is, and though most people will do it, there will always be someone unpersuaded by this ""this is how"" advice",4,4,2,2,5,5,5,4
19,"they have a point, i think many of us would agree with it. and they present it in a way that is easy to relate, i think",4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4
20,twitter and decency don't usually go hand in hand. i'm not a fan,4,2,4,4,4,3,3,2
21,"i'm guessing the speaker is describing a marginalized area of poor and probably black people. they have first hand experience of how this urban marginalization affects people's psyche and they are expressing it from that stand point, in the first person",4,1,3,3,5,4,4,1
22,"i think it's very interesting to speculate about the areas of cognition that we are yet to figure out scientifically. the speaker is foregrounding the unknowns about the science of dreams, which i think makes them trustworthy, if maybe a little less interesting",4,2,2,2,3,4,4,5
23,sounds interesting but the speaker's voice or tone makes it less so,4,4,2,3,3,3,3,4
24,"marketplace regulations are important, granted. though the speaker is very vague, and doesn't seem to be substantiating their claims sufficiently",2,4,2,2,4,4,4,4
25,it is easy to find this an entertaining story. i guess this is the founder of airbnb? never knew it stood for that. huh!,5,2,2,3,3,3,3,4
26,hard to tell what the point or context is around this interaction... but the speaker is not making too much sense as is,2,4,2,2,2,3,3,4
27,these kinds of topics escape so much my expertise that it's hard not to want to either fully trust the (putatively) knowledgeable speaker or fully distrust them because i don't know what they're talking about,4,2,2,4,4,4,4,2
28,the speaker has a point but they're a little too fatalistic regarding the prospects of technological development,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,4
29,seems like an interview discussing the speaker's company's relationship with biz partners. they seem to be honest about failures and successes,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4
30,"yes okay, we should be informed about how the big guys are taking the right steps toward alleviating climate change effects, but it's also a little boring to me. or maybe the speaker is boring, not the topic",4,4,2,4,4,4,4,5
