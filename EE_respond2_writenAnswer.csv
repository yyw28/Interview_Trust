1,"It is important that we protect all citizens’ rights based on our constitution and our laws. It is also that we protect our country and trust that the governmental agencies responsible for national security are doing their best, altho we know that there is corruption, mistakes, coverups etc that can be expected when humans are involved.",3,4,3,2,3,3,4,4
2,Important topic for Americans but there is no new news here so kinda boring. I didn’t learn anything new.,4,3,2,3,4,4,4,4
3,Global warming is an important topic and challenge that we need to deal with regardless of whether people get their timelines right or not. To not be able to differentiate between a wrong projection / prediction and a lie does not reflect well on the accuser.,1,4,3,1,1,1,1,4
4,Someone reporting what she heard.  Sounds reasonable and sounds like a delivery of facts.,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4
5,This sounds like two buddies having fun talking about football and some good bantering going back and forth.,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4
6,Sounds like some politician defending him/herself and throwing some accusation or criticism back the other way.  The sentence not well constructed and I had to real it a few times to see what it was trying to convey.  People who are dishonest speak like this on purpose so that they sound like they are saying something when they are not and you can’t pin anything back onto these vague sentences that make no sense.,2,4,3,1,1,1,1,3
7,"Important topic but the entire long boring paragraph could have been summarized in three short sentences.  More contagious, less deadly, we don’t know yet how it will play out but believe it won’t be as bad as earlier variants.",3,4,2,2,2,3,3,4
8,We know there are too many variants of everything. Booooring,3,5,2,3,3,3,3,2
9,"Team sports is very important for everyone and in so many ways. People learn to work together, achieve common goals, respect their opponents, and learn to win and lose gracefully.  A team prayer or individual prayer is a means of self reflection, focus building, stress management and confidence building. How great is that!",5,2,4,4,5,4,4,4
10,"Realistic view on how to solve problems and conflicts through discussion, anticipating disagreement and thinking thru how to deal with it.",4,2,3,4,4,4,4,4
11,Sounds like an author discussing his book for teens.,4,2,3,3,4,4,4,4
12,I learned something that I didn’t know! The topic was explained well and in very simple language. It is a delivery of facts so I deem the speaker trustworthy,5,1,3,5,5,5,5,5
13,Good way to remind people to take emotions out of elections. Reminding them that they are voting for how they want their tax dollars to be spent. And to evaluate whether the candidate has the competency to make the policies happen,5,2,4,5,5,5,5,5
14,So true!  Selling out to capture more revenue and trying to garner mass appeal totally destroys what made the original great.,5,2,4,4,5,4,4,5
15,Not sure what the person’s message is. The ere appears to be a couple of ideas but none landed.,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,4
16,"Need more context to judge. I may guess that the speaker is talking about low fat or fat free food where they replace fat with lots of sugar, starch and xanthan gum.  But this is just speculation.",3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4
17,This answers the question that everyone has:how did so many educated parties get duped?  The reason given also makes sense.  Often this happens in big corporations when management don’t believe in their own employees’ messages when it isn’t the message they want to hear.  Nobody wants to be the one who goes against the flow and end up losing their job if the competition wins by sticking with Theranos,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,5
18,Good advice that is so old and tedious that many people don’t wants to hear it or follow it. Not sure how someone can tell it in a more persuasive way that will lead to more compliance.,5,4,3,4,5,5,5,5
19,This happened to everyone even before the pandemic but tte pandemic made it worse as technology made it possible to have a full meeting after dinner.,5,3,3,4,4,4,5,5
20,I remember this.  Think it was from the CDC trying to stop people from self medicating and harrassimg medical staff about drugs that don’t work against Covid 19,4,1,5,4,5,5,5,5
21,Urban plight and decay has been around forever and some neighborhoods have little to no resources. Social services are theoretically available but bureaucracy to get the services wear people down.,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,4
22,Someone trying to understand or explain rem sleep and dreams but I was not able to follow the reasoning or where they were going.,3,5,1,2,2,3,3,4
23,Someone trying to explain how Newton’s third law is applied to motion in different medium. Simple easy to follow even if not the most eloquent speech,5,3,3,4,5,5,5,4
24,"Important concept but not well argued by speaker.  For me he did not present a coherent argument about why a free market needs to be regulated as at first blush, free and regulated appear to be an oxymoron.",4,3,3,3,3,4,4,5
25,Love to hear these stories of the American dream.,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5
26,Without context I give the speaker the benefit of a doubt that they are coming from a genuine place talking about fair treatment for all,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,5
27,Someone talking about innovation in payment systems I think can't really figure out exactly what they are specifically talking about,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4
28,Someone talking about modern day problems. Not offering any solutions so it is just a rant at this point but important topic nevertheless,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4
29,Think this may be Theranos again.  Speaker sounds defensive against something reported by journalist?  This is what I am surmising from the paragraph.,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,4
30,Someone talking about the Paris Accord and goals to remediate climate change challenges.,3,4,2,3,3,3,3,4
