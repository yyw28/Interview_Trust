,text,Trust,boring,lively,persuasive,reasonable,trustworthy,logical,feel about the topic
1,i really cannot tell you... i don't know,5,1,4,4,4,2,3,3
2,"it seems this is a conversation on economics. due to my limited knowledge about this, i would automatically trust the words and expertise of whomever i discuss this topic with. but this would also make me automatically not trust them, because i'd feel as if walking in a dark room. in general, this is not a topic i am comfortable with",5,2,4,5,2,2,2,2
3,"global warming is what is being discussed, i'm guessing, so, i feel good about this topic. it seems one conversation partner is stuck in some data or fact about it, while speaker c wants to move on to the facts. not too much understanding going on between them it seems",2,2,5,4,5,4,4,4
4,"this just seems like a scene from a movie, if i'm honest. what could i say? i guess the word ""russia"" in a north american context just brings up a reflex of untrustworthiness, in general. ",4,2,4,4,4,2,3,3
5,i don't know,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,3
6,"i don't know about the topic, but this speaker's lack of grammatical coherence would send red flags if i were to answer this question, which has strong accusatory vibes",2,3,4,2,4,2,2,3
7,"i am a little tired of hearing about covid, like everyone else. hard to tell without context, but the question at the end seems rhetorical. a rehtorical question makes the speaker more trustworthy than if they said ""hospitals won't be able to keep up."" the latter would indicate an unduly confidence in their predictions, whereas the open ended question signals a certain humility in the face of an unprecedented medical situation",3,4,2,2,4,4,4,2
8,"i'm guessing the topic is about ""this stuff"" that is found in all cereals which is probably something negative, maybe high fructose corn syrup or artificial chemicals of another kind. this is boring to me, because it always ends in that kind of complacency that is illustrated by the question at the end. i also think the speaker is exaggerating their feelings by saying ""paralyzed with anxiety"" probably in an attempt to appear sympathetic. that makes them untrustworthy",5,4,2,3,4,2,4,2
9,"sports and gossip-type, behind-the-scenes discussion. yes, that's fun to listen to. but hard to comment on the trust that may be present in the conversation. it's also hard to imagine this intervention happening anywhere but in a public-facing setting",4,2,5,5,4,2,4,5
10,"this speaker's voice is too sure of itself. people tend to get too self-righteous about this topic to begin with, but this person seems to have the backing of some kind of fame as a tv host. all of it breathes untrustworthiness, if you ask me--too much charisma, probably a male. also, sweeping statements: ""we love not to think"" ",4,1,5,5,4,1,4,4
11,"seems they're dealing with some freudean issues here. awful topic. once you get into the realm of the subconscious (of which childhood years are constitutive), there just isn't much wiggle room to have a rational conversation",1,4,3,2,4,2,4,1
12,"seems some big issue is being discussed. but the tone seems laid back, at the same time",4,2,4,3,4,4,4,2
13,i don't know,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
14,"i'd say this was even fun to read. i'm guessing it's a podcast episode or talk show. not sure if it's the lengthy statement, or the animated nature of the speech (when they wave ""hi"" to indicate inclusion into the described group), or the topic. it is discussed in a conversational and lively tone, as is appropriate for the topic. ",4,1,4,4,4,4,4,5
15,"the politics of covid and vaccines is just not a topic i want to hear about any longer. hence my negative stance. though it seems the speaker is bringing up a somewhat nuanced grey area within the topic, implying that covid vaccines, contrary to common sense, is not a bipartisan issue necessarily ",4,4,2,3,4,4,4,2
16,"having trouble understanding, though i guess based on tone, the conversation seems friendly and inspiring a degree of mutual trust",3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3
17,"what would the topic be, conning? i feel neutral about it. but the topic is being treated somewhat uncritically maybe. i mean, i guess people from small towns should technically be less worldly, easier to con, than ""brilliant"" people? but those just seem unfair distinctions. no, don't like this speaker or how they address the topic",4,2,3,2,2,3,2,3
18,seems the speaker is feeling optimistic about the prospects of life post-vax,5,4,3,4,4,4,4,2
19,open outlook to the way sheltering in place has affected our lives,2,4,2,4,4,3,4,2
20,"i guess a person can be reasonable and untrustworthy at the same time. reasonable because of the logic of what they're explaining, but too implicated in the topic for me to be able to trust what seems at least on surface level a reasonable stance",1,2,5,5,4,2,4,2
21,"i dont feel positively about police anything, but i feel positive about discussing in the open experiences of being policed. ",4,4,2,2,3,3,3,4
22,"seems like the speaker is trying to do some translation work from technical stuff about the brain into a language they can understand, so necessarily they must have to have some trust in the interlocutor's speaker. which seems it'd be easy to do as they seem to be an expert in the topic",5,4,2,3,4,3,4,4
23,"innovation in energy sources, discussed with a view on the future",4,3,4,3,3,3,3,4
24,i don't know. successing is not a word,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3
25,"business trends? discussed in public i guess, tryin to be informative",4,4,4,3,3,4,3,4
26,love the british dry sarcasm there. maybe a little too much to inspire trust,1,2,4,4,4,2,4,4
27,"this conversation seems to lack basic trust, as if the speaker is harshly scrutinizing their interlocutor's motives",2,4,4,4,4,3,4,2
28,"i guess any time someone asks a question, a basic level of trust must be assumed to be present. otherwise, why ask?",4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
29,"i don't know, but i like the thought experiment the speaker proposes",2,4,4,4,4,2,4,3
30,"paris agreement is good, i guess? as good as it gets at least. i am a little tired of answering questions, is that valuable data? i mean, i feel less inclined to examine why i should distrust a speaker. so, paris agreement = good in my tired brain",3,4,2,3,3,3,3,4
