,text,Trust,boring,lively,persuasive,reasonable,trustworthy,logical,feel about the topic
1,Sounds like someone trying to rehabilitate/persuade  a person who works for the other side. I would trust anyone to work on our election system unless they have been cleared for 100 % (understanding that ther is no guarantee) trustworthiness.  ,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4
2,Not sure why speaker chose the word “weapon” but I understand it to mean tool. Interest rate is an important tool or lever that the Fed to modulate our economy and I believe that we have the right people in the right place who are thoughtful and careful about how they wield this tool. ,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,4
3,"When someone say let’s forget about what was said in the past without explaining why, my antenna goes up and it make me more leery of what the speaking is trying to sell me on. ",3,3,3,1,1,2,2,4
4,It seems like the speaker is trying to gather information about a call that the listener has attended but that the speaker has not.  But this isn’t clear so the speaker comes across as not clear in objective. ,4,3,3,2,2,3,2,4
5,"Not enough information about the context. The speaker could be more polite by using “please”; however, the statement could be a command or a demand.  Cannot judge in the absence of context",3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
6,Don’t understand what the speaker is trying to say. It may be someone who is a foreign language speaker who is doing a word for word translation of what they are trying to express.  It could be someone is hasn’t complete put together their thoughts.  Will need more clarification. ,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,3
7,God that someone is thinking ahead about consequences of an important happening.  ,4,3,3,3,5,4,5,4
8,Just someone making conversation and sharing agreement with a sentiment. We have too many variants of everything these days. Wish the people who spend their days coming up with these superfluous stuff do something that can benefit society.  ,5,3,3,3,5,3,5,4
9,Just sports chitchat.  A usually enjoyable and benign topic. ,5,3,4,3,3,3,3,4
10,PC is an important topic and the speaker has a point that it has gone overboard with people afraid to express their true opinions and feelings. Polite and honest dialogue leads to progress.  White lies out of fear of persecution leads to pent up frustrations that lead to extremists in hiding.  ,3,2,4,4,3,3,3,4
11,Someone is about to share information to shed more light on a topic being discussed. We hope that this will be honest and useful information that will be shared and received with respect and trust. ,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4
12,Not sure what they are talking about so need more info and context to answer the questions ,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
13,Not enough information.  Speaker could be persuaded or enlightened or just trying to get along on some topic that is not that important to him,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
14,Anime is not my thing so I found the long meandering soliloquy boring. It also went around in circles and never landed. Maybe it did but any point being made was lost in the tangled mumbo jumbo.  Speaker appears to be someone who was unprepared and rambling. ,4,5,3,3,3,4,2,3
15,Good that someone is asking for a balanced view of the Republican Party and seeking more visibility to into the party’s strategy. ,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,4
16,Sounds like someone is talking about sports topic that I don’t understand.  Maybe they are trading players?  Appears that h to e speaker is explaining his opinion which is always a good thing. ,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,3
17,"This is the question of the day about Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes. It involves so many interesting topics like greed, caveat emptor, pretty privilege, Silicon Valley sub-culture…endless cocktail party topics that are also important topics in business, law, sociology, psychology….this is want the first not will it be the last of this type of deceit",4,3,3,4,4,4,4,4
18,Good that someone is planning and taking precautions about possible super spreader event.  One statement didn’t make sense. How can tests make sure that people are vaxed and boosted?  Tests are to test for infection,5,3,3,4,4,4,4,5
19,"Important topic about flex time, work life balance, and how to manage ",5,3,3,4,4,4,4,5
20,This deals with misinformation on a very important topic. The speaker is not clear on what he is saying. I was not able to figure out the points that he was trying to make. The rant took a couple of turns and his message got lost ,2,3,4,2,2,2,2,5
21,Speaker trying to seek understanding from an author who has experiences and points of view that he is interested in.  Sounds like an interview ,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4
22,"Someone seeking understanding about a topic. I like the way the speaker asks for metaphors as he is helping the listener with how he the speaker learns, by use of metaphors and imagery ",4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4
23,Not sure what the speaker is talking about.  Maybe alternative fuels?  The gravity comment is somewhat confusing. Maybe he is trying to solve a machinery design problem?  ,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
24,Appears that speaking is trying to find out if something is working but we don’t know the context so cannot comment. Assume he means are we “succeeding”,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
25,Appears to be a talk show in front of a live audience. Nothing much more to say  ,4,2,3,3,4,3,4,3
26,Question that goes around and slowly making traction. There may be underlying reasons for the talent gap and wage gaps like many women prioritize family and child rearing.  A person only has that much time and that much energy so people who ask these questions are sometimes not digging deep enough into facts and research. ,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5
27,"Good questions toward underwriters that make sun prime loans. Appears like the speaker is trying to understand how the subprime loan business works and through it uncover some cautions that they public should be aware of, whehh to er they are investors apt loan seekers. ",3,2,4,3,4,3,4,5
28,Need more conrext,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
29,This sounds like a question from the Theranos trial. Not clear whether this is prosecutor or defense attorney asking. They are bounded by rules in how they can pose their questions. ,3,2,3,3,4,3,4,4
30,Speaker just stating a fact. Sounds like he is saying that it is a good thing. ,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
